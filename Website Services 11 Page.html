      during the dry seasons. On average people spend up to $200 per month per acre. This is not including the maintenance and repairs of the system used 
      to keep your grass watered. Turf can actually help save 55 gallons of water for every square foot. This will cut the price tag of your water bill 
      significantly. You will however still get the benefits of a lush green look. Not only will it save you money, but it may help your family or customers 
      be more comfortable if they have allergies. This will give you the same look a healthy grass has without all of the allergens. This will allow those dealing 
      with these issues breathing easier. No need for more allergy pills. Dealing with growing grass can become a chore or another bill to deal with if you pay 
      someone to mow it. Even if you do it yourself you’ll have to be equipped with a whole plethora of tools. from mowers, edgers, sprinklers, and spreaders.

      and most importantly save you time! On average synthetic turf can last you more than 15 years, even under heavy use. It’s virtually free of maintenance.

      installation job done by Santa Rita Landscaping in Tucson. Artificial grass is pet friendly. Many of us have pets who can take their toll on our lawns. 
      Fortunately, with modern turf, they’ve been designed to last! This is why many sports arenas tend to use turf. If they can handle dozens of athletes playing 
      intense and physical sports, it can surely handle our pets with proper turf installation. Another big concern is if pet waste can damage your synthetic grass. 
      The good news is, turf again is very tough. As a bonus, it’s also actually very easy to clean and even deodorize. Once you scoop up your pet’s droppings, you 
      can use a hose to clean the fake grass off. Under the turf there will be a layer of either polyurethane or latex, this will help the water to move after hosing it down. 
      Some pets can leave behind an odor even after cleaning. For this, there are many cleaning mixtures that are safe to use. Some even use a simple vinegar mixture. Once it 
      all dries your turf will be clean and odor-free. Thankfully, pets are not an issue when it comes to turf. Contact Santa Rita Landscaping today to get your turf installation 
      service done as soon as possible to enjoy these benefits!
