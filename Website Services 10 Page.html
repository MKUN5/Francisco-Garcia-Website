        <h2> Garcia Landscaping: Tree Pruning </h2>

      <p id=content> 
      Trimming trees and shrubs helps ensure safety, promote plant health, and maintain beauty. But improper pruning can weaken the branch structure, cause cuts 
      to improperly heal and encourage the growth of suckers that can divert energy from those areas of the tree that need it most. When you need the help of an
      experienced tree-trimming specialist in Tucson, AZ, Gabes Family Landscaping is the only call you need to make. Properly pruning trees and shrubs requires
      an understanding of tree species, knowledge of best practices for pruning in Tucson, AZ and a commitment to ongoing education. The arborists at Gabes Family
