    <h2> Garcia Landscaping: Landscape Maintenance </h2>
    
      <p id=content> Are you having trouble finding the time to maintain your landscape? We’ll do it for you! We offer landscape maintenance services for residential,
      commercial, apartment complexes and HOA communities. We provide landscape maintenance services for residential, commercial, apartment complexes, and HOA communities. 
      Some landscaping companies specialize in residential services or commercial services only. We offer them for all types of living and working communities. If you have 
      a tree that needs trimming, a property that needs automated watering, or an irrigation system that needs a checkup; we’ll take care of it for you. Our services are 
      long-term. Many times property owners and managers change their landscaping company nearly 2-3 times every year. We ensure a commitment to you and your landscape. 
      We guarantee that your service for the first few months will be equal to the service we provide for you three years later. We guarantee it. Our contract prices 
      don’t increase as often as other companies. An increase of prices on a contract put pressures on your finances. We understand that. We guarantee that your contract 
      will not increase in price just because it’s the anniversary date. Fully Insured – We value your property, that’s why we carry worker’s compensation, general liability, 
      and auto insurance. We respect your property and make sacrifices to ensure that no harm comes to it. We take full responsibility.</p>
